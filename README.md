## **📌 Overview**
This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify plant leaves into three categories:
- 🌱 **Healthy**
- 🍂 **Powdery**
- 🌾 **Rust**

The model is trained from scratch on a balanced dataset, achieving **95% accuracy** on the test set.  
It is lightweight, easy to extend to more classes, and suitable for potential **edge deployment**.
